2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Implement unit, integration, and E2E testing
3. **Security Enhancements** - Secure credential management and input validation

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Total Effort**: 26-36 hours

### Phase 2: Development Experience (Medium Priority)
4. **Docker & CI/CD** - Containerization and automated deployment
5. **UI/UX Improvements** - Design system, accessibility, responsive design
6. **Real-time Monitoring** - Agent status monitoring and notifications

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Total Effort**: 30-42 hours

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium-Low Priority)
7. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API documentation
8. **Advanced Autonomy** - Scheduler, memory system, collaboration features
9. **Performance Analytics** - Monitoring, error tracking, analytics dashboard

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Total Effort**: 34-46 hours

## Quick Wins (Can be implemented first)

1. **Fix unused imports** - Already completed âœ…
2. **Add .env.example file**
3. **Set up basic ESLint configuration**
4. **Add LICENSE file**
5. **Create basic CONTRIBUTING.md**

## Breaking Changes

### Issues with Potential Breaking Changes:
- **Security Enhancements**: Users will need to re-enter API keys
